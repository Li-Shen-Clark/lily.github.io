- 1 **Cross-City Mobility and Market Integration: Evidence from Vegetable Price Covariation in
China**

This paper utilizes high-frequency data on fresh vegetable prices across China to
examine the determinants of intercity price dispersion. We developed a Python program to obtain the vegetable price data from a website maintained by China’s Ministry of Commerce. For our empirical analysis of intercity price dispersion, we construct the intercity price dispersion for this vegetable is then measured by the monthly standard deviation of the daily relative price for each city pair. Also, we used a Python program to collect daily information on cross-city passenger mobility from the website AutoNavi maintained by a leading mapping and navigation services provider in China. For our empirical analysis, we synthesize this travel flow information into a monthly mobility intensity index for each city pair. With these data, we perform the following analysis. First, we start with a gravity regression, where the standard deviation of the relative prices (V_ijT^k) is regressed on the logarithmic distance between cities, conditional on month fixed eﬀects and city dummies. Second, we examine the eﬀects of HSR connection with a diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences specification, where V_ijT^k is regressed on the logarithmic distance and the dummy for HSR connection, conditional on month fixed eﬀects and year fixed eﬀects. Third, we regress price dispersion on logarithmic distance and the intercity mobility index, conditional on month fixed eﬀects. Finally, we discuss how reduced price dispersion increases social welfare, and perform some back-of-the-envelope calculations to gauge the overall economic significance of our estimates.


- 2 **Quantitative Analysis of Local Export Multipliers in China**

This paper studies how international trade aﬀects the aggregate output of the local economies in China.
Specifically, we focus on the local multiplier eﬀects of exports on GDP across Chinese provinces. By quantifying the model to the data, this paper addresses two central questions: how do the local export multipliers diﬀer across Chinese provides? and What shapes the patterns of the local export multipliers?
We develop a two-sector, multi-region general equilibrium model to examine the mechanisms through
which the local multiplier eﬀects work. First, we introduce domestic frictions into the Eaton and Kortum
[2002] framework, following the approaches of Tombe and Zhu [2019] and Fan [2019]. Second, building on Caliendo and Parro [2015], we incorporate input-output linkages within the Eaton and Kortum structure to account for the multiplier eﬀects from other sectors. Third, we extend the model to a multi-sector framework, as demonstrated by Costinot et al. [2012]. Upon formalizing the model, we derive a key theoretical proposition that identifies the determinants of the local export multiplier. The model is calibrated using the 2017 China Multi-Regional Input-Output (MRIO) Table provided by the CEADs database1 to estimate critical parameters such as trade costs and sectoral productivity. To further explore the
determinants of these multipliers, we conduct a counterfactual analysis by simulating the economy under
alternative parameter configurations using additional MRIO data from 2012.
