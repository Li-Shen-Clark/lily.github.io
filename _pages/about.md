- 1 **Cross-City Mobility and Market Integration: Evidence from Vegetable Price Covariation in
China**

This paper utilizes high-frequency data on fresh vegetable prices across China to
examine the determinants of intercity price dispersion. We developed Python programs to obtain daily vegetable price data and daily information on cross-city passenger mobility. With these data, we perform the following analysis. First, we start with a gravity regression, where the standard deviation of the relative prices is regressed on the logarithmic distance between cities, conditional on month-fixed eﬀects and city dummies. Second, we examine the eﬀects of HSR connection with a diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences specification, where the standard deviation of the relative prices is regressed on the logarithmic distance and the dummy for HSR connection, conditional on month fixed eﬀects and year fixed eﬀects. Third, we regress price dispersion on logarithmic distance and the intercity mobility index, conditional on month fixed eﬀects. Finally, we discuss how reduced price dispersion increases social welfare, and perform some back-of-the-envelope calculations to gauge the overall economic significance of our estimates.


- 2 **Quantitative Analysis of Local Export Multipliers in China**

This paper studies how international trade aﬀects the aggregate output of the local economies in China.
Specifically, we focus on the local multiplier eﬀects of exports on GDP across Chinese provinces. By quantifying the model to the data, this paper addresses two central questions: how do the local export multipliers diﬀer across Chinese provides? and What shapes the patterns of the local export multipliers?
We develop a two-sector, multi-region general equilibrium model to examine the mechanisms through
which the local multiplier eﬀects work. Upon formalizing the model, we derive a key theoretical proposition that identifies the determinants of the local export multiplier. The model is calibrated using the 2017 China Multi-Regional Input-Output (MRIO) Table provided by the CEADs database1 to estimate critical parameters such as trade costs and sectoral productivity. To further explore the determinants of these multipliers, we conduct a counterfactual analysis by simulating the economy under alternative parameter configurations using additional MRIO data from 2012.
